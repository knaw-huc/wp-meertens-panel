              and the making of<br>
              the Dutch Golden Age</h1><br>
              <p>The Golden Agents focusses on the creative industry in the Dutch Golden Age. We connect datasets from the Gemeente Amsterdam Stadsarchief, Uva,  Rijksmuseum and others. We create ontologies and agent tools to understand the relations between the several creative disciplines and the relation between the production and consumption in the Golden Age.</p>
